PlateGP is a Matlab-based computer code for the inverse problem of obtaining plate stiffness values from measurement data, and physics-informed forward solutions of plate physical responses. The scripts Example1a_SSRecPlate.m and Example1b_SSRecPlate_SNR.m contain the verification of the model for a rectangular simply supported plate, while Example2_FixedRecPlate.m implements a plate model in fixed support conditions. The folder GP_Plate_Model includes an implementation of Gaussian Processes, while the Example folders contain the details for the analytical flat plate analysis and plots. The details on of the utilized methods are given in the abovementioned article.
